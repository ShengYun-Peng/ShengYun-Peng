## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am ShengYun (Anthony) Peng, a CS PhD student @Georgia Tech 

## Research interest:
My research advances safer, more efficient, and robust AI systems at scale â€” spanning training, inference, and deployment â€” by tackling core challenges in safety alignment, inference efficiency, and scalable system design across language, vision, and multimodal models:
- **Advancing Safety Alignment Throughout Model Training**: LLM safety basin, the first framework explaining how minimal unsafe data can collapse alignment during fine-tuning (NeurIPS'24); robust CNN architectures that achieved SOTA on RobustBench (BMVC'23 & Best Poster Award); dynamic safety shaping framework for LLM finetuning risk mitigation (In Submission).
- **Optimizing Inference for Scalability and Throughput**: video VLM scaling study for optimal inference (ACL'25); token reduction method that doubles LLM inference throughput (In Submission).
- **Bridging Research and Deployment for Real-World Impact**: UniTable, a modular table parsing system with over 470+ stars (workshops at NeurIPS'23 (oral), AAAI'24 (oral), & NeurIPS'24); distributed systems tutorials on Medium (33K+ readers).
