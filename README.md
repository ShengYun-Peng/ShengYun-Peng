## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am ShengYun (Anthony) Peng, a CS PhD student @Georgia Tech 

## Research interest:
My research strengthens the generalization and safety of the generative AI, spanning vision models, LLMs, and VLMs. As steps towards this goal, I work on:
- **Generalizable multimodal representation learning**: foundation models for table recognition (UniTable, Table Transformer, Self-supervised Pretraining), RGB-infrared fusion object tracking (DsiamMFT, SiamFT), structural health monitoring (system identification).
- **Safe and robust machine learning models**: LLM loss landscape (coming soon!), robust CNN design principles (#1 on RobustBench CIFAR-10), multi-task person tracking (SkeleVision), and defending LLM attacks (LLM Self Defense)
